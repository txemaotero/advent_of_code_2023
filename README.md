# Advent of code 2023

My solution for the AOC 2023 puzzles. This year I have decide to implement my
solutions in C++ using the 23 standard so I can get familiarized with the string
processing and modern range-based utilities.

## Day 1

Input: each line is a string with at least 2 digits.

- Part 1: For each line create a number with the first and last digit and sum
  the numbers for all the lines.
- Part 2: The numbers in the lines might be spelled.

## Day 2

Input: A list of games were balls of three colors were picked from a bag.

- Part 1: Sum the ids of the games that are possible with a given maximum value
  of balls of each color.
- Part 2: Find the sum of the products of the minimum balls required by each
  game to be possible.

## Day 3

Input: An array of numbers, symbols and dots.

- Part 1: Sum all the numbers next to a symbol.
- Part 2: Sum the product of pairs of numbers that are connected through a "*".

## Day 4

Input: Cards with lottery winning numbers and the list of numbers you play.

- Part 1: Sum the points given by all the cards.
- Part 2: New rule to force picking card copies. Find the total number of cards
  you end up with.

## Day 5

Input: A list of seeds and dictionaries to convert seeds into other categories.

- Part 1: Find the lowest location (last kind of the conversion chain).
- Part 2: The list of seeds were pairs of values and range (more seed ids to
  evaluate).

## Day 6

Input: Pairs of values for times and distance.

- Part 1: Calculate the games you can play to beat the record of the given
  distance in the given time.
- Part 2: The vales were only a single long value.

## Day 7

Input: Hands of cards with an associated number.

- Part 1: Sort the hands with some rules.
- Part 2: Rules modification to allow Jokers.

## Day 8

Input: First line is a series of left and right instructions, the rest are the
instructions to build a double linked list.

- Part 1: Number of instructions to run until the end of the list is reached
  (ZZZ)
- Part 2: Number of instructions to run until all the posible starts (end with
  A) reach the and at the same time (node ending in Z).

## Day 9

Input: Sequence of numbers in each line. Calculate a Pascal triangle
subtracting.

- Part 1: Estimate the next value of each series and add all.
- Part 2: Estimate the previous value of each series and add all.

## Day 10

Input: An array with connected pipes.

- Part 1: Distance to the furthest point.
- Part 2: Area enclosed.

## Day 11

Input: Array with sparse galaxies

- Part 1: Find the sum of shortest distance between pairs adding a row and col
  in places without galaxies.
- Part 2: The same but replacing empty rows/cols with a million empty rows and
  cols

## Day 12

Input: Each line is a combination of characters indicating working as break
pieces. The ? means unknown. At the end of the line there is a sequence of known
contiguous working pieces.

- Part 1: How many compatible configurations are in total.
- Part 2:
