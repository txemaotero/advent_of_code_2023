# Advent of code 2023

My solution for the AOC 2023 puzzles. This year I have decide to implement my
solutions in C++ using the 23 standard so I can get familiarized with the string
processing and modern range-based utilities.

## Day 1

Input: each line is a string with at least 2 digits.

- Part 1: For each line create a number with the first and last digit and sum
  the numbers for all the lines.
